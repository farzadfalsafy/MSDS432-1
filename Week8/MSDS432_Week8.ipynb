    "### How is the algorithm greedy?\n",
    "The algorithm searches for the guard with the minimum hours already assigned, and then gives them a full shift (if under the overtime limit) and a half shift (if over the overtime limit). This is greedy in that it searches for the immediately least expensive guard to assign a new shift. This keeps the guards' time equitable and everyone under the overtime limit (insofar as it is feasible).\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the complexity of the solution?\n",
    "The complexity of the solution is $O(n^2)$ - this iterates over a loop to check for the set condition (if the given number of hours are fulfilled), then iterates over the dictionary of guards to assign them more hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Did the greedy algorithm provide the best solution, or could there have been a better solution to the problem? Why or why not?\n",
    "The algorithm provides the best solution available, though there are outside factors that might change this (e.g. the possiblity of hiring or firing some of the guards when there aren't enough to give them each full-time employment). For the given constraints, the solution output from the greedy algorithm is optimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### If the scenario had different values for the inputs, would your algorithm still be successful? Eg. more than 24 hours, higher overtime, shorter shifts, or values that don't factor so nicely. Why or why not?\n",
    "My algorithm may take into account different numbers of guards or hours, and assigns half-shifts based on whether all guards are currently at the overtime threshold (to promote workplace fairness). \n",
    "\n",
    "### What things would change the optimal output?\n",
    "The ability to hire or fire guards might change the optimal output, depending on the initial parameters (this may not always be the case). Not speaking strictly in terms of \"optimal\" in the mathematical sense, there could conceivably be handling for the case where several guards meet the same minimum, selecting a random guard to receive the next shift (it currently goes sequentially through the dictionary by default).\n",
    "\n",
    "### If you were not constrained to a greedy algorithm, what approaches would you take to solve the problem?\n",
    "I would likely choose the same algorithm since this is simple and spreads the hours evenly. If constraints were taken off (like the previously mentioned ability to hire and fire), I might write this in a different fashion."

    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "The developed algorithm takes overtime pay into account with a few realistic constraints (shifts cannot be broken down further than 4 hours, no personnel changes, no one is preferred for OT work). Given these constraints the `set_hours_daily` and `set_hours_weekly` algorithms provide optimal solutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases, there are several optimal solutions: three guards for eight hours each or six guards for four hours each are both optimal in the case of a daily scheduler - the algorithm makes no distinction, except that hours are spread as evenly as possible. It is up to the user to provide the number of employed guards."
