There are many ways to solve any problem so whatever solution seems appropriate to you for this week, utilize it and then explain your reasons for choosing it.  Greedy algorithms is just a concept, there is no particular algorithm that is called 'greedy algorithm', rather many of the existing algorithms use 'greedy' technique, for example, Breadth-first search and Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm are some examples of greedy algorithms"
